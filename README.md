# bookclub
code snippets, ideas, and summaries from the ttdsm book clubs

## Repo Structure

```shell
bookclub
├── README.md
└── effective-go  -- directory with name of book/article/blog
    └── README.md -- reading schedule/basic summary
```

## House Keeping
- Book club takes place every two weeks.

- Each week, someone new will lead book club, 
  including writing the summary, selecting a problem,
  and leading discussion.

- First 20 minutes or so we will discuss the readings
  Next 30 minutes or so will be spent reviewing code
  Last 10 minutes we will talk through the reading schedule 
  and pick who is leading next.

 - The leader has the first week to come up with and share the problem.
   The rest of the group has the second week to complete the problem.

 - Each person will work on the problem in their own branch of the repo
